Basic features
  Packet serialisation/deserialisation
Packet classes
  Automatically generated from burger data
  Some packets may be manually defined instead of generated from burger data
  All packets inherit from opencraft::packets::base_packet
Basic usage:
  Open TCP socket, read in full packets, decompress/decrypt, send to base_packet::unpack_packet, get back a packet object
  Create packets by passing relevant fields to the relevant classe's constructor then pack it and send it across the TCP socket
  Fields are assigned alphabetical names (i.e first is a, second is b and so on) unless proper field names have been defined
