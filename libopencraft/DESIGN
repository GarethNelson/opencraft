Basic features
  Packet serialisation/deserialisation

Packet reader
  Pass a socket fd, get back a packet - blocking (so should only be called when the socket is ready to read from)

Packet classes
  Automatically generated from burger data
  Some packets may be manually defined instead of generated from burger data
  All packets inherit from opencraft::packets::base_packet

raw_packet encapsulation
  all packets may be wrapped inside a raw_packet by serialising the packet and then passing it to raw_packet's constructor
  raw packets may then be wrapped inside of zlib compression etc before final transmission

Basic usage:
  Create a TCP socket and a packet_stream instance
  Read from TCP socket, pass to packet_stream on_recv, iterate through the returned vector and handle the packets
  Create packets by passing relevant fields to the relevant classe's constructor then pack it and send it across the TCP socket
  Fields are assigned alphabetical names (i.e first is a, second is b and so on) unless proper field names have been defined
