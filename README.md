# OpenCraft

This is an attempt to rewrite minecraft as free software, currently a work in progress so don't expect it to work properly yet.

It is split into 3 components (and some random old legacy stuff) named after similar components from Second Life because i'm nostalgic as hell:

+ opencraftd: the server component, needed even for single player games

+ newview: the client component, this is what you run if you want to actually play the game

+ libopencraft: a C++ library for handling serialisation and deserialisation of minecraft packets

All game logic is handled by the server whenever possible, so both components are required to run the game.

## Build instructions - server (opencraftd)

Note that opencraftd is currently not under development, it is recommended you use cuberite instead (https://www.cuberite.org).

First ensure you have the relevant dependencies installed, newsim requires the following C++ development packages that should be available on any modern GNU/Linux distro:

* CMake version 3.0 or later
* Boost version 1.55 or later
* A working C++ compiler with C++11 support - developed & tested on gcc 4.9.2-10 from Debian Jessie
* jsoncpp - see https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp

You can then build the server by doing the following:
 1. cd opencraftd/
 2. mkdir -p build/
 3. cd build/
 4. cmake ..
 5. make

## Build instructions - client (newview)

Note: heavy work in progress, the below may be out of date

The client requires the following packages in addition to what the server requires:

* SDL2
* OpenGL development headers
* PhysFS

## Running the client

First you must make sure you have an appropriate texture pack. Due to copyright law it is NOT legal to distribute the textures and sprites from the original minecraft so instead a freely available texture pack named OSReP is included in newview/texture_packs/osrep/. Please see the bottom of this document for information on the license for this texture pack.

If you are happy to use the default texture pack you can simply start the server as indicated above and then start newview in a similar manner:

1. cd newview/build/
2. ./newview -r..

As with newsim, the -r option simply tells the client where the install root is and should point to the source checkout location for newview.

If you would like to use an alternate texture pack you must specify it on the command line using the -t parameter after installing it into newview/texture_packs/, for example to use a texture pack named "mypack" you would do this:

./newview -r.. -tmypack

## Format of texture packs

Texture packs mostly share the same format as minecraft texture packs with a few key differences:

1. Inside assets/ the subdirectory may be named either opencraft or minecraft
2. The texture pack may be a .pk3 file instead of a directory
3. textures/gui/title/minecraft.png should be replaced with textures/gui/title/opencraft.png and be 512x128 pixels big

pack.mcmeta files may be included, but if not found everything will still work.

## Thankyous, license notices, attributions and such

OSReP is included in this repo as the default texture pack.
The license for OSReP is Creative Commons Attribution Sharealike for the block textures, "no stated restrictions" for those classed as "doku-stuff", creative commons attribution sharealike for item sprites and an informal "reuse so long as you credit DataErase" for the music tracks.

Please see the images in texture_packs/osrep/credits for full details on OSReP.

The title text in OSReP has been replaced with something generated by cooltext.com, it'll probably be replaced properly at some point.

Additionally, i'd like to thank some of the guys on freenode #mcdevs and especially those listed in the CONTRIBUTORS file for helping with specific issues.

## FAQ

Q: Why?

A: Because minecraft is an awesome game and is increasingly being used for non-game purposes and I believe it requires a free software implementation.

Q: Is bacon delicious?

A: Yes
