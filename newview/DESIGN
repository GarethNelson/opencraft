Basic architecture
  C++ main process
  Python logging hooked to boost logging
  Embedded python
   Twisted/quarry
  OpenGL rendering + SDL event loop
   Game state is updated inside of python
   Renderer is implemented in C++ for speed

Threads
  Main renderer and SDL thread
  Python thread containing quarry

Core of the client is implemented in Python for simplicity

Main loop queues up events from SDL, passes over to Python and gets back game state to render
