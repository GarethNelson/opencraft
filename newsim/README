Why is this called newsim?
Nostalgia and second life, that's why

How to build it:
 1. mkdir -p build
 2. cd build
 3. cmake ..
 4. make

How to run it:
 1. cd build/
 2. ./newsim -r..

For usage options:
 1. cd build/
 2. ./newsim -h

For debugging and no daemon:
 1. cd build/
 2. ./newsim -r.. -fd

The -r option is needed to point to the install root - which in a real system will eventually be something like /usr/local/share/opencraft or whatever, but while developing it's just the source root.
