Basic architecture
  Multithreaded server daemon
  1 thread per client (switch to async later)
  Clients accepted and spawned into unique threads
  Client threads use in-process zeromq to distribute events to listeners in other threads

Threads:
  Main thread
   Listener thread
   2 Thread per client
     1 - reader
     2 - zeromq writer

Client reader thread
  Listens for packets, passes to appropriate handlers and zeromq topics

Client zeromq writer
  Listens for zeromq messages on appropriate topics and sends packets to client
